# Test(s)
You need to setup the test facilities before moving forward.
Or, you can't went far in the future.
## App.test.js
The first test file has already been generated for you once installed in previous chapter.
And you can easily find element by its content and validate it.

But, that's not enough. We are using ReactJS and Redux and these frameworks are asynchronous.

Now, let's try something async and see how we can test it.
Modify your App.js like this to add an async button and a message span to hold result which we are going to validate.
```typescript
import { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [msg, setMsg] = useState('hi');
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <span data-testid="msg">{msg}</span>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            setMsg('there');
          }, 1000);
        }}>
        say
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
