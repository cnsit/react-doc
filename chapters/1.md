# Install
First, get the framework installed.
You will need a decent network and powerful machine to run it, and pickup a comfortable root folder (if you have local git server, you may want to use its root folder instead of the **github**). In this doc, I arbitrarily set the root folder as **~/repos**.
Replace the project name **bh4dcl** with your favored one.
```bash
cd ~/repos
npx create-react-app bh4dcl --template typescript
```

Pour yourself a cup of coffee and then return back when it's done.
Don't run the startup code, clean your repo first.

Possible errors may be 
```bash
Need to install the following packages:
  create-react-app
Ok to proceed? (y) 

You are running `create-react-app` 4.0.3, which is behind the latest release (5.0.0).

We no longer support global installation of Create React App.

Please remove any global installs with one of the following commands:
- npm uninstall -g create-react-app
- yarn global remove create-react-app

The latest instructions for creating a new app can be found here:
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
```
Then you can 
```bash
npx create-react-app@latest bh4dcl --template typescript
```
## clean up
```cd bh4dcl```
Before you can trully start up you project, you'd better clean up the defaults brought by the **npx** installer.
Here is a list of the files you are going to delete
| file               |
| :-----             |
| public/logo192.png |
| public/logo512.png |
| src/logo.svg       |

Then, modify these files so you can remove the dependencies of the above detelted files.
| file                 | modification                                                                                                                                          |
| :--                  | :--                                                                                                                                                   |
| README.md            | Dump its content and put what ever you want to say for your new project                                                                               |
| public/index.html    | Delete the **&lt;link&gt;** href to the "logo192.png"                                                                                                 |
|                      | The **<title>** content to your favored one.                                                                                                          |
| public/manifest.json | The **short_name**                                                                                                                                    |
|                      | The **name**                                                                                                                                          |
|                      | Remove the "logo192.png" and "logo512.png" part                                                                                                       |
| src/App.js           | Remove the imports of **React** and **logo**                                                                                                          |
|                      | Dump the **&lt;header&gt;** element in the **&lt;div&gt;**, replace it with "hello" so you will have **&lt;div className="app"&gt;hello&lt;/div&gt;** |
| src/App.test.js      | Replace **/learn react/** with **/hello/**                                                                                                            |


Now, test see it's still working:
```npm t```
Lucky enough, you will the see a beautiful **green** result.

## redux
You may also want to try **redux** (like me), then you can install it by
```bash
# npm
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
# yarn 
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```

While there is a one-line command and can create your react app and install redux once for all:
```bash
# Redux + TypeScript template
cd ~/repos
npx create-react-app bh4dcl --template redux-typescript
```

Don't clean up the default **clock** slice for now, since you will need it as your own slice's reference later. Or you will endup with jumping back and forth between the redux doc and your code.
